[Code and Artifacts on Github](https://github.com/sharpninja/esp32\_c64\_keyboard)

This project provides a reference design for using an ESP32 with Blue Tooth as a keyboard for the **Commodore 64**, **Commodore 64c**, and **Commodore VIC/VC-20** home computers.  The firmware uses an [Arduino Sketchbook](design/software.md).

With this [hardware](design/Hardware), you will be able to control your Commodore computer with either a **Blu Tooth keyboard**, **USB Keyboard**, or via a **secure webservice over WiFi**.

## Requirements

* Arduino IDE 2 or equivalent
* ESP32 Dev Board or equivalent
